This folder contains a simple test to verify if Azure AI Agents with Bing Search are working correctly.

## Test File

### `test_end_to_end_setup.py` ‚≠ê **MAIN TEST**
- **Simple test for Azure AI Agents + Bing Search**
- Tests all essential aspects:
  - Environment variables
  - Azure authentication
  - AI Foundry connectivity
  - Bing Grounding Tool creation
  - Agent creation with tools
  - Basic search functionality
- Creates a test agent with Bing Grounding Tool
- Performs a real search test
- Cleans up test resources

## How to Use

### Run the Test
```bash
cd setup
python test_end_to_end_setup.py
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the test, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**: `env.local` file is configured with:
